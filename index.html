                <h1>Welcome to the Debug Playground</h1>
                <p> Here are some exercises I threw together to showcase some aspects of the chrome developer tools.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="slider">
                <div class="exercises">
                    <div id="exercise-1">
                        <h2>Exercise #1: Finders keepers</h2>
                        <p> You will need to find the <code>app.js</code> file in the <code>sources</code> tab.<br>
                        If you get stuck, take <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/">this</a> as your guide.</p>
                        <button class="button-64" role="button" id="exercise-1-btn">Good Luck!</button>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exercise-2">
                        <h2>Exercise #2: Looper</h2>
                        <p> There is a never ending loop, we need to stop it from running somehow.<br><br>
                        Tip : do not close your console as once you click the button it will be harder to open it.<br><br>
                        Restrictions: Do not modify the code in the sources tab.<br><br></p>
                        <button class="button-64" role="button" id="exercise-2-btn">Attempt exercise 2</button>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exercise-3">
                        <h2>Exercise #3: You Passed! (Maybe)</h2>
                        <p> This exercise will involve reading a conditional and figuring 
                        out why it is not evaluating as true, then making it be so.<br><br>
                        Restrictions : This must only be called by refreshing the page
                        </p>
                        <button class="button-64" role="button" id="exercise-3-btn">Attempt runs on reload</button>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exercise-4">
                        <h2>Exercise #4: Undefined Behavior</h2>
                        <p> This exercise will involve looking at the object returned in the debugger.<br>
                        See why it is failing without peeking at any function definitions.</p>
                        <button class="button-64" role="button" id="exercise-4-btn">Attempt exercise 4</button>
                    </div>
                    <div id="exercise-5">
                        <h2>Exercise #5: Blackout</h2>
                        <p> To solve this one, you will need to find where we can see the response to this fetch and figure on what the failure is.</p>
                        <button class="button-64" role="button" id="exercise-5-btn">Attempt exercise 5</button>
                    </div>
