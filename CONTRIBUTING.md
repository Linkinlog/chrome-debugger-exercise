# Contributing to Chrome Developer Tools Challenges

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features or challenges

## Getting Started

This project consists primarily of some vanilla javascript for the exercises and `index.html` file to display them, there's nothing particularly special to set up for you to contribute. Just make sure you have a text editor that supports JavaScript and HTML.

## Contribution Rules

1. **Creating a new branch**: Always create a new branch for your work. This helps to keep our project organized and makes it easier to review your contributions.

2. **Using Prettier**: We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to keep our code formatted consistently. Please make sure to run your code through Prettier before submitting a pull request.

3. **Rebasing**: While not required, we prefer if you rebase your branch before submitting a pull request. This helps to keep our commit history clean and easy to follow.

## How to Contribute

If you want to propose new features or changes, please create an issue with a detailed description of what you'd like. If you want to make the changes yourself, you can fork this repo and create a new branch with your changes. When you're done, submit a pull request and we'll review it as soon as possible.

## Contribution Acceptance Criteria

We only have two criteria for accepting contributions:

1. **It aligns with the project theme**: This project is all about helping users learn to use the Chrome Dev Tools. Any contribution should help further this goal.

2. **Code is formatted**: Please format all code with a tool like Prettier before submitting. This helps to keep our codebase clean and easy to read.

## Community Expectations

We expect everyone in our community to be respectful and responsible. We value constructive feedback and inclusive, positive interactions. Any behavior that is disrespectful or harmful to others will not be tolerated.

## Reporting Bugs or Requesting Features

We plan to use issue templates to make reporting bugs or requesting new features easier. These will be available in the future, and will provide you with all the necessary information we need.

## Code of Conduct

A detailed code of conduct will be established soon, providing a comprehensive set of guidelines for community behavior. Until then, we expect all contributors to behave professionally and respectfully towards each other.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Chrome Developer Tools Challenges!
